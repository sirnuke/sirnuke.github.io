## Introduction

<!--[Tagline here!]-->

</header>

Hello, I'm a software engineer in Southeast Michigan, who feels the
default GitHub user overview isn't user friendly as it could be!

### GitHub Projects

#### [Steambridge](https://github.com/sirnuke/steambridge)

> *SteamBridge* is set of tools enabling Steam users to run their
Windows-only games inside of Wine while still using the native Linux
Steam client.  In a phrase: Wine DLL that captures a game's Win32 Steam
API calls and reorganizes the parameters to call the Linux equivalent.

#### [Dumb C Logging](https://github.com/sirnuke/dumb-c-logging)

> *Dumb C Logging* is a very simple, single header file for formatting
output in C, for any sort of project that doesn't need the many overbuilt
external libraries.  By "any sort of project" I mean my various C/C++
projects, because I was tired of rewriting this over and over again.

#### [~config](https://github.com/sirnuke/unix-settings)

> *My basic \*NIX configuration files*, aka my ongoing collection of
"With this, I can make Vim a step closer to what Visual Studio had cerca
a decade ago!"

#### [Soup Kitchen](https://github.com/sirnuke/soup-kitchen-love)

> *Soup Kitchen* is an on again/off again [Love2d](http://love2d.org)
based Lua game, with the end goal of simulating managing a soup kitchen
in an FTL-esque gameplay.

#### [Github.io](https://github.com/sirnuke/sirnuke.github.io)

> *This Webzone, Which Is a Webzone*.  If there's any curiosity, though I don't think it's all that interesting.

#### [Full GitHub Profile](https://github.com/sirnuke)

> *And the full page* for various scratch projects that I've worked on.

#### Major Automotive OEM Infotainment System

Or as I like to call it, MAOIS (no relation).  A big Linux ARM C++
codebase that's available as an option on a certain brand of cars.
I've been working on deep integration with certain mobile OSes as well
as spare system tasks, such as investigating coredumps GDB struggles
to parse.

#### V2X

Vehicle to vehicle based communication, which I guess falls under the
category of Internet of Things these days.  In sort: "hey, I'm receiving
a message from a car in front of me, how do I determine it's a valid
actor and how likely we're to collide with it?"

#### TrafficJamCam

A series of mobile applications for Android and iOS for accessing
Department of Transportation traffic cameras in your city.  In short,
"I'm going home, is I-94 backed up?" Of course, silly, but now you can
know for sure.  Far less useful with Waze these days, but I think it
got taken down a number of years ago.
